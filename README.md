Hi!

Cybersecurity is the cool kid on the block. Breaking into stuff seems really fun, and it is. We just have to do it the right way. I'm trying to develop a guide out of this, but it doesn't make much sense to do so, as Codepath provides a great set of resources. Nevertheless, these repos can help you learn a good deal in cybersecurity. It covers attacks like:

i) SQL injection - 
Where we all start (after getting over third party apps). The project associated to this mainly covers preventing these attacks and in doing so, helps understanding them.

ii) XSS - 
Cross Site Scripting is really relevant. That's how I guess you should start pen-testing something. It comes in a lot handy in comments sections, urls (not that often though), iframes, et cetera.

iii) XSRF - 
This is one of the professional ones (well, all of them are). It takes some work. Can help in getting into banks, but no bank is this stupid anymore. Still, authentication systems can be compromised and how to prevent such a thing from happening, is important. Prevention basically revolves around XSRF tokens.

There are other things here too - like session hijacking, prevention, IDORs, et cetera.

I would be adding more stuff here, covering more attacks and preventions, because you know it - this is the real deal.

Anybody interested in contributing and any professional laughing at this, please add stuff. I and a lot more people would love to learn from others.
